# âŒ¨ Iosevka AK2 and Iosevka AK2 Prose

My own version of the font [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/). Thank you, Belleve Invis!

Iosevka AK2 is the condensed/compressed version with cherry-picked letters. Iosevka AK2 Prose is extended, quasi proportional version of the same selection of letters.

Thanks also goes to [this Iosevka build guide by Kaushik Gopal](https://kau.sh/blog/build-iosevka-font-mac-os/), for helping me to get through changes in the Iosevka build system, which I dumped into a Github Action with a couple of details - like a proper versioning/release scheme. I hope the next time I reinstall my computer, I won't end up with repository that's unable to build.

ðŸŒž Have a nice day.
