# âŒ¨ Iosevka AK2 and Iosevka AK2 Prose

My own version of the beautiful [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/) font. Thanks Belleve Invis!

Iosevka AK2 is the condensed/compressed version with cherry-picked letters. Iosevka AK2 Prose is extended, quasi proportional version of the same selection of letters.

I tried the Docker install, everything failed. Tired and sad, I've read through [this Iosevka guide by Kaushik Gopal](https://blog.jkl.gg/build-iosevka-font-mac-os/) and put there into Github Action. With few details (like a proper versioning/release!), I hope the next time I reinstall my computer, I won't end with repository that's unable to build.

ðŸŒž Have a nice day.
